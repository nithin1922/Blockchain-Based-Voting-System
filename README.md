# Blockchain-Based Voting System 🗳️

A **decentralized voting application** built on the **Ethereum blockchain**, ensuring **secure**, **tamper-proof**, and **transparent** electronic voting. The system leverages **Solidity smart contracts**, **Web3.js**, and a **React.js frontend** to create a robust blockchain-based election process.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Secure & Tamper-Proof** – Votes are stored on the blockchain, preventing fraud.  
✅ **Decentralized** – No central authority controls the election.  
✅ **Transparent** – Anyone can verify votes on the blockchain.  
✅ **One-Person-One-Vote** – Ensures fair voting by preventing duplicate votes.  
✅ **Real-Time Results** – Automatically updates as votes are cast.
